ADRT: Approximate Discrete Radon Transform
==========================================

This is the documentation for the `adrt` package, a Python library
providing an approximate discrete Radon transform operating on `NumPy
<https://numpy.org/>`__ arrays.

This library includes routines for computing the forward ADRT, a
back-projection operation, several inverses, and related utility
functions.

To get started, follow the :doc:`installation instructions <install>`
then consult the :doc:`quickstart guide <quickstart>` for an
introduction to the use of the library.

Our :doc:`examples <examples>` demonstrate applying these routines to
various sample problems and include recipes for developing new
functionality using this package. Detailed information on each
function is included in the :doc:`API reference <reference>`.

The library source code is available in our `repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/karlotness/adrt>`__.
